--------------------
FROM INDIVIDUAL COMMITS
**both datetime come to be the same but since they have them seperated i figured they're not always **
committed_datetime :: datetime
commit size :: int
hexsha :: int ( not sure if important)

commit files changed ** from commit_stats = commit.stats.files
	- filepath :: string		
	- file count :: int ** work in progress
	- insertions :: int
	- deletions :: int
	- lines changed :: int extremely annoying challenging to module up, web scraping part 2

Repository info on Languages ** in progress,
