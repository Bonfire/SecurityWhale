# Security Whale Data Collection and Parsing Tool

This is a tool designed specifically for collecting and parsing data received through Githubs API and Github repositories. This tool also ties in with our Security Whale application which is a desktop application that clones a users repository and pulls and parses that repository locally and display whether or not that specific repo has security bugs in it.

## Motivation

Programs can have hundreds of files each containing over a thousand lines of code and it can be difficult at times to determine whether or not there might be security issues within the code. Using this Tool we can pull meta data from Github repositories
and run them through our Machine Learning Algorithm to determine the likelihood of there being a security issue in a specific file.

## Code Style

This Program uses PEP 8 as its standard for its coding style
